Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and Web3 have become a huge part of society lately. I have been interested in each of them for a long time and decided it would be perfect to pursue for SciFest.
AI is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, it involves creating algorithms and models that enable machines to process data, recognise patterns, and make predictions or recommendations. 
My interest for Web3 and Crypto goes back to the first lockdown. From the many AI project ideas I had, I chose this one. One of the main reasons for choosing this idea was my interest for Web3 and Crypto and my previous investments in the Cryptocurrency, Oasis (ROSE). Choosing this idea meant I already had a deeper understanding of the Oasis background.
I started my project on March 23rd 2023. My project involves the creation of an AI. I decide to use a VAR model to predict the ROSE prices. VAR is a type of statistical model used to analyse the relationships between time series variables. This model predicts the future  ROSE prices within a specific time frame, based on historical data. It plots the predicted prices onto a graph and outputs the RMSE, which is a metric to evaluate the performance of a model.
After developing the AI, I decided to develop a website to showcase my work and results for other peopleâ€™s accessibility. This was not the main aim of my project and is only for presentation purposes.
