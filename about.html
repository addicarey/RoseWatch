        Here I briefly go over the main components and terms mentioned in this project
        and give an overview of the whole development process.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Blockchain Technology</b>
        <br />
        A blockchain is a decentralised, distributed database that records transactions on 
        multiple computers, servers and devices. Once a block is added it cannot be deleted,
        altered or changed without the alteration of all the previous. Each block contains a 
        cryptographic hash of the previous block, which ensures that the data within each 
        block cannot be altered without changing the entire chain.
        <br />
        <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>
        <br />
         AI is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines 
         that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI involves developing 
         algorithms and computer programs that can learn from and make predictions or decisions 
         based on data. These algorithms can be trained on large datasets, enabling them to 
         recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions that are accurate and consistent.
         Some well known AIs include Siri, Alexa and ChatGPT.
        <br />
        <b>Cryptocurrencies</b>
        <br />
        Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that uses cryptography to secure and 
        verify transactions and to control the creation of new units. Cryptocurrencies use 
        decentralised technology, meaning they are not controlled by a single entity
        Instead, they rely on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies, they are not 
        backed by a physical asset or government, but instead are based on mathematical algorithms 
        and community consensus.
        <br />
        <b>Web3</b>
        <br />
        Web3 or the decentralised web, refers to the use of blockchain technology to enable
        decentralised applications (dApps) and peer-to-peer (P2P) communication on the Internet.
        Compared to the traditional web (Web2.0) the decentralized web is built on decentralized 
        networks and protocols that allow for greater security, transparency, and censorship resistance.
        <br />
        <b>Oasis Network</b>
        <br />
        The Oasis Network is a decentralized blockchain designed to provide secure and private 
        data storage, as well as scalable and efficient transaction processing. Oasis ROSE is the native
        cryptocurrency of the Oasis Network. It is used to pay for transaction fees on the network and 
        can be used to access various services and applications built on top of the network. The 
        Oasis Network is considered the future due to its unique approach to solving the privacy and 
        scalability issues facing existing blockchain networks.
        <br />
        <b>Vector Autoregression (VAR)</b>
        <br />
        Vector autoregression (VAR) is a type of statistical model used to analyze the relationships 
        between multiple time series variables. It takes into account the fact that each variable 
        in the system can be influenced by past values of all the other variables. Essentially, 
        it's a way of predicting future values of multiple related variables by using their past values.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>RO$E-Watch</b>
        <br />
        In it's simplest, RO$E-Watch is an AI that predicts future ROSE prices based on historical data.
        It predicts a certain time frame I specify based on all the historical data prior to that time frame.
        A simple analogy would be temperatures. Lets say I have a months worth of data consisting of different
        daily temperatures. I want to predict the temperatures for the last week of the month, so i use all 
        the temperature data I have from the previous weeks to predict the time frame I specify (in that case, the
        last week of the month). I decided on this cryptocurrency because I have personally invested in it before
        and Oasis is being considered the future. My AI uses historical data fetched by a CoinMarketCap API to 
        predict 'future' prices. It's considered the 'future prices' in this case because its using historical data from 
        before the time frame I specify. I used a VAR model to predict these prices. The performance of the model
        is measured in RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) which is a metric to evaluate the performance of a 
        machine learning model. RMSE is calculated by taking the square root of the mean of the squared differences 
        between the predicted and actual values. The lower the RMSE, the better the model's performance. In one 
        of the graphs the RMSE was 0.01505448, which is very low meaning the model is performing very well. I decided
        for accessability purposes to created a website displaying my work for other people to view. The website
        was not the main goal of my project and is for presentation and accessability purposes.
